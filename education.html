  <p>I was always a creative child at heart. I constantly draw and design new things. I also played a lot of instruments since I was young: Violin, piano, ukelele, and both acoustic and electric guitar. Another creative hobby I like to dabble in is writing. I always loved to create random storiees and connect with anyone who reads them.</p>
  <p>Starting young, I have always loved video games. i started off streaming on and off as a kid and knew I wanted to make my own. I am pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science with an emphasis in game development. In many of my academic projects, I always tried to relate to video games with my newfound coding skills.</p>
  <p>In my career, I plan to implement my coding skills and my creativity in creating video games.</p>
