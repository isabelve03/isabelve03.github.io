    <h2>Hi, I'm Isabel!</h2>
    <p>
      As a designer, I create experiences that allow individuals to immerse themselves in the worlds of my creation. 
      My inspiration stems from the many years of unraveling the wide arsenal of creative arts in video games. 
      All interactions are unique and personal, giving the opportunity to create lasting memories within the experience. 
      I value creativity, emotional connection, and fostering community in the powerful and relevant medium. 
      In my career, I envision utilizing all that I am to give people an experience just like I had. 
      Whether it be through code, art, or writing, my voice of love and comfort intertwines with my work; 
      the artistic expression designs experience and brings about community. 
      I aim for immersion through interaction with stories, choice, and the sense of comfort from my designs.

  <h3>My Personal Philosophy</h3>
  <p>
    I believe in self-improvement. Having an open-mind and consistenly sharpening your knowledge will equip you for all sorts of challenges and opportunities.
    The growth gained from learning from others or self-taught skills will keep a fresh perspective and a strong mindset.
    This prevents staying stagnant and prevent negativity. Play games, share stories, and indulge curiosity.
